        <p class="para">Although, we don't have a brick oven to make our wondeful pizza, we can recreate the same exact pizza we love in our own homes with the following recipe!<br>
            If you don't have time to make the dough it is perfectly fine to buy store bought dough. From there we will add some delicious tomato sauce, (once again you<br>
            can buy the sauce) next add some delicious mozzarella, and finally, your toppings!</p>

            <ol class="assemble-pizza">
                <p class="assemble-dough">For dough</p>
                <li>In a food processor we are going to mix together the bread flour, sugar, sat, and yeast until well mixed.</li>
                <li>In a measuring cup, combine ice water and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for 20-30 seconds, until a ball of sticky dough forms.</li>
                <li>Move the dough into an oiled surface, and knead it until smooth, place it in a bowl and cover it with plastic. Refegirate overnight before using.</li>

                <p class="assemble-sauce">For the Sauce</p>
                <li>In the same food processor combine the tomatoes, garlic, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, basil, and some sugar. Process it until you see the sauce become smooth.</li>
                
                <p class="final">Assembling the Pizza</p>
                <li>Divide the dough to your liking of size.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 450-550 Farenheit or the highest setting your oven can go.</li>
                <li>Dust your workspace with flour and place your dough on top. Begin pressing the dough until gets wider and leave the edges thicker for your crust.</li>
                <li>Pick up your dough and let gravity stretch it out. Until you get a size of your preference.</li>
                <li>Begin to lather your dough with sauce, once again to your liking. Just remember to evenly coat it and make sure some of the border of your dough is exposed.</li>
                <li>Scatter the mozzarella, and pop it in the oven. Make sure the crust is well browned and the cheese is bubbling. </li>
                <li>Enjoy!!</li>
