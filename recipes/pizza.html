        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Although, we don't have a brick oven to make our wondeful pizza, we can recreate the same exact pizza we love in our own homes with the following recipe!<br>
            If you don't have time to make the dough it is perfectly fine to buy store bought dough. From there we will add some delicious tomato sauce, (once again you<br>
            can buy the sauce) next add some delicious mozzarella, and finally, your toppings!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>For pizza dough</strong></p>

                <p><strong>For the pizza sauce</strong></p>
                <li>1 (28-ounce) ca whole peeled tomatoes undrained</li>
                <li>2 medium garlic cloves minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or more, to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            
                <p><strong>For toppings</strong></p>
                <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella or more, shredded</li>
                <li>toppings of your choice</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>For dough</strong></p>
                <li>In a food processor we are going to mix together the bread flour, sugar, sat, and yeast until well mixed.</li>
                <li>In a measuring cup, combine ice water and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for 20-30 seconds, until a ball of sticky dough forms.</li>
                <li>Move the dough into an oiled surface, and knead it until smooth, place it in a bowl and cover it with plastic. Refegirate overnight before using.</li>

                <p><strong>For the Sauce</strong></p>
                <li>In the same food processor combine the tomatoes, garlic, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, basil, and some sugar. Process it until you see the sauce become smooth.</li>
                
                <p><strong>Assembling the Pizza</strong></p>
                <li>Divide the dough to your liking of size.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 450-550 Farenheit or the highest setting your oven can go.</li>
                <li>Dust your workspace with flour and place your dough on top. Begin pressing the dough until gets wider and leave the edges thicker for your crust.</li>
                <li>Pick up your dough and let gravity stretch it out. Until you get a size of your preferance.</li>
                <li>Begin to lather your dough with sauce, once again to your liking. Just remember to evenly coat it and make sure some of the border of your dough is exposed.s</li>
                <li>Scatter the mozzarella, and pop it in the oven. Make sure the crust is well browned and the cheese is bubbling. </li>
            </ol>
