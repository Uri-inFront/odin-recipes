        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First, we are going to cook the beef tongue, so we are going to have to wash it and remove any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Next, we will set up a large stockpot with herbs, garlic, and spices and put the meat into the pot.</li>
                <li>Finally once you see the meat is cooked (will look greyish) take it out and cut it into little pieces.</li>
                <li>Set up your pan with some oil and set the meat to cook, once you see it fully cooked, it's time to make the tacos!</li>
                <li>Set up your pan with some oil and flip them tortillas with some tongs (hands if you're not scared to burn yourself a little).</li>
                <li>Chop up some onions and cilantro into thin cuts.</li>
                <li>Grab your tortilla and start layering them with meat , cilantro, onion, and some sauce if you have!</li>
                <li>Enjoy with some lime and a cup of coke and you are all set!</li>
            </ol>
